/// A *fieldExpression* can use a date literal to compare a range of values to the value in a *date* or *dateTime* field. Each literalis a range of time beginning with midnight (00:00:00).
///
/// To find a value within the range, use =. To find values on either side of the range,use > or <.
/// The following table shows the available list of date literals, the ranges they represent, and examples.
///
/// # Note:
/// - If the UNIT in LAST_N_UNIT:n is any unit except DAYS, the date literal does not include the current day. So, for example, LAST_N_WEEKS:1 does not include today.
/// - The two date literals LAST_N_DAYS:n and LAST_90_DAYS do include the current day. So, for example, LAST_N_DAYS:1 includes yesterday and today. And LAST_90_DAYS includes 91 days, not just 90.
///
/// # Minimum and Maximum Dates
/// Only dates within a certain range are valid. The earliest valid date is 1700-01-01T00:00:00Z GMT, or just after midnight on January 1, 1700. The latest valid date is 4000-12-31T00:00:00Z GMT, or just after midnight on December 31, 4000. These values are offset by your time zone. For example, in the Pacific time zone, the earliest valid date is 1699-12-31T16:00:00, or 4:00 PM on December 31, 1699.
